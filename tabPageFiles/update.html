			<br />
			<h2>How's it going?</h2>
			<span style="font-size: 30px; font-family: Vegur;">
				It's going pretty well for me. It's been a few sleepless nights here because I've been so fixated on bringing you a totally bad ass update to this extension. I think I succeeded.
			</span>

			<h2>What I Changed!</h2>
			<span style="font-size: 30px; font-family: Vegur;">
				The list of changes in this update is pretty comprehensive, but I'll keep it short. 
				<ol>
					<li>LINKS ARE NOW SORTABLE!! Yes. All caps. Because you know you wanted sortable links. My very first commenter (you know who you are) asked specifically for sortable links and WHAM there it is. All you have to do is click the "edit links" button and drag each link where you want it to go.</li>
					<li>Enhanced the look and feel of very literally EVERY single element in the entire application. It should look and feel easier and sexier to use.</li>
					<li>Enhanced functionality. Though you don't see it and don't care about it, the underlying code for this update is incredibly smooth.</li>
					<li>I changed the clock settings so they should now reflect the proper 12 hour clock time, NOT the 24 hour time you're used to. It looks better, I promise.</li>
				</ol>
			</span>
			<h2>How to contact me / Support</h2>
			<span style="font-size: 30px; font-family: Vegur;">
