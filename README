Have you ever opened a new tab page and just gotten sad and complacent? So have I. In an attempt to solve this problem, the Bad Ass New Tab Page (BANTP, for short) was born.

Right now, in version 0.1.2, BANTP does one thing: changes your default new tab page to something a little nicer on the eyes.

What you can expect from future versions: (yep, roadmap time!)

0.2: Ability to create, update, and remove your own custom links, as well as add the current page to the list of links on the new tab page.

Note: Minor version 0.2 will be the first official version released to the public in the Google Chrome App Gallery. At this time, version 0.1.2 has been released to a small group of testers. Please email me at piercemoore@gmail.com if you would like to participate in testing.

0.3: Custom fonts and images

0.4: Small, built-in task manager

0.5: Built-in alarm clock

0.6: Work with links, alarms, and tasks right from the URL bar (omnibox).

0.7: Ability to re-arrange links as well as move around different modules (alarms,tasks,links) on the home page.

0.8: Encrypt and store links and settings files remotely to secure server, OPT-IN

0.9: This version number reserved specifically for bug-checking and debugging.

1.0: The non-beta, 1.0 official release of this extension will come along with a newly released web service that will allow you to manage your links in a web interface as well as track version history and enable undo/redo for any mistakes you may have made accidentally deleting a link from your tab page. 

Get excited, people. Convenience and raw awesomeness are on the way :)
