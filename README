The Bad Ass New Tab Page extension is a solid attempt to make the default new tab page of Google Chrome a thing of the past. That nasty old bugger.

Download this extension in the Google Chrome extension gallery (coming soon) or its home page, http://bantp.refreshedweb.com!

Stay tuned. Awesome things ahead.
